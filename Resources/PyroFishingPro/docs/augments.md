## Augments and Custom Enchantments
We have custom enchantments for Fishing Rods using a Cauldron, enhancing your fishing abilities with effects like increasing fish yield, increasing fish xp, increasing fish value, etc.

These are realized by creating augments.
Augments are custom enchantments specific to fishing rods only. You can view a list of augments in-game by typing `/fish augments`. To apply a fish augment, type `/fish augment` and put the fishing rod and the augment into the GUI, click the Confirm button and that's it! 

Each augment has a unique purpose, crafting recipe, and max enhancement level. Each augment will require a certain fishing level (the plugin's level, NOT MCMMO) and a certain amount of entropy.

To create an augment:
- Find the augment you want to make.  Maybe note down the recipe somewhere.
- Ensure you have enough entropy and /fish level for the augment you will be crafting.
- Place a cauldron (with or without water).
- Toss the ingredients of the augment you want.  Make sure they all went in the cauldron or within 1.5 blocks of the cauldron.
- You can only make one augment at a time.  Even of the same type.
- Strike the cauldron while holding a fishing rod. It will explode out an augment.


To apply the augment:

- Open /fish augment.
- Put your rod in the left slot and the augment in the slot next to it.
- Click the green pane on the middle right.
- It will make a sound, and the augment will be applied to the rod

Removing augments:

- All augments on the fishing rod can be removed at once (this will cost some entropy). 
- Open /fish augment.
- Put your rod in the left slot.
- Hover over the TNT symbol at the bottom right of the window.  Carefully read the text shown!  When ready, click the TNT symbol. The augments on the rod should now either be in your inventory or on the ground for retrieval.
